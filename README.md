# toTheBeatToTheBop
A dancing game!!! Inspired by arrows as buttons, sounds, beats, and of course the dance classes I've taken in Los Angelos. Hopefully, this is somewhat entertaining, whatever it is, it is just the start to what technology and creative arts can do :) Hope you enjoy this beginner game.
